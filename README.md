# Python Sorting, Searching, and Data Structures

Welcome to the Python Sorting, Searching, and Data Structures repository! This repository contains well-documented Python implementations of fundamental sorting and searching algorithms, as well as various data structures. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced developer seeking reference material, this repository has you covered.

## Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**: Classic bubble sort implementation with explanations.
2. **Selection Sort**: Simple selection sort algorithm with step-by-step comments.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Efficient insertion sort code with performance analysis.
4. **Merge Sort**: Iterative merge sort implementations.

## Searching Algorithms
1. **Binary Search**: Binary search for sorted arrays with iterative solution.
2. **Linear Search**: Linear search in lists with time complexity analysis.

## Data Structures
1. **Linked List**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with insertion, deletion.
2. **Stack**: Stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.
3. **Queue**: Queue and deque implementations with enqueue and dequeue operations.
4. **Binary Tree**: Binary tree data structure with various traversal methods.
5. **Dictionary**: Basic dictionary (key-value store) implementation.
6. **Lists, Tuples, and Sets**: Exploring Python's built-in data structures with usage examples.

Each algorithm and data structure is accompanied by clear explanations, time complexity analysis, and usage examples. Feel free to explore, learn, and use these implementations in your Python projects. Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged!

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository and explore the code and documentation. You can find detailed usage examples and explanations in each algorithm and data structure's respective directory.
